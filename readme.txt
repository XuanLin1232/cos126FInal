This program creates teams from individuals based on their hard skills and soft skills demonstrated in their resume. 
 Given an input of individuals’ resumes from a testing and training file (which include keywords), the program first 
classifies individuals based on the percentage of their resume which is made of keywords, then uses the KNN algorithm
 to predict their skill level.  Then, the algorithm generates balanced random teams from these classified individuals
 by forming teams composed of an even number of individuals from each classification.  The results are then output on 
a GUI which displays the teams as well as statistics about each team member.
